    <!-- Here is how thymeleaf uses its fragments.. I know it looks like a comment, but its not.
    I can help if you guys want to make any more fragments for stuff that will be on every page, such as 
    links/src stuff for js, jquery pugins, navigation stuff, etc -->
    
    <!-- This specific fragment holds all of the links and sources we need to include on each page.
    These are things like css files, javascript files, etc.. This is where our bootstrap
    source links are.  -->
    
    <!--/*/ <th:block th:include="fragments/headincludes :: head"></th:block> /*/-->
    
</head>
<body>
	
	
	<!-- This is where the top navigation bar is held.. -->
	
	<header><!--/*/ <th:block th:include="fragments/header :: header"></th:block> /*/--></header>
    
    
    <!-- Start each page body with these two divs.. Also the next div and leftnav -->
    <div class="container">
    	<div class="row">
    	
    	
    	<!-- This is the left vertical navigation menu. -->
    		<div class="col-lg-3">    		
        		<leftnav><!--/*/ <th:block th:include="fragments/leftnav :: leftnav"></th:block> /*/--></leftnav>

    		<!-- You can insert more row divs if you want more rows in the first "row" the first
    		"row is mostly just to get all content lined up -->
    
    
    
    		<!-- Then end the content with the closing divs for container and row.. You can 
    		Also add more rows after this if needed, but we shouldnt need to. -->
