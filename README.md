# HouseOfCards
A Spring MVC web application built for a final capstone project for Forsyth Technical Community College.

# Where to Put What
```
HTML files (.html) - src/main/resources/templates
JavaScript files (.js) - src/main/resources/static/js
JQuery files - src/main/resources/static/jquery

Images - src/main/resources/images
```


Dont worry about java stuff, since I will be doing that.


# Other
This is only for the webplatform. If we end up doing other apps, like our game-buddy app idea, we will create another repo.
