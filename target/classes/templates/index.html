    <!-- This will not need to go here since it will be in ever page's header. So this will go in the 
    headerincludes.html page instead.. You can see how you need to format the paths for the src/rel in 
    there. If you need help with those, ask Alex to help. --for now I have placed an example css file in static/css
    which just has some random formatting for tables. You guys can change anything in there if you want. For now,
    I just have that and some jquery bootstap stuff to make the pages look ok until we start doing
    our own formatting.

    <!-- Here is how thymeleaf uses its fragments.. I know it looks like a comment, but its not haha.
    I can help if you guys want to make any more fragments for stuff that will be on every page, such as 
    links/src stuff for js, jquery pugins, navigation stuff, etc -->
